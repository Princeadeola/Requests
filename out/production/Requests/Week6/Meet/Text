Week6Meet - 10 pts
Turn in on BBL as soon as complete, but before end of day Friday following the lecture.
Answer these questions as we progress through the meeting.
1.Declare an array of type int that will hold 50 numbers:
ANS:
int[] numbers = new int[50];

2.Declare an array of type String that will hold the inner planets:
ANS:
String[][] planets = new String[50][];

3.Print out Earth from the previous array.
ANS:
for (String element: array) {
    if (element.toLowerCase().equals("earth")){
        System.out.println(element);
    }
}

4.What is the error you get when you attempt to access an array element that is outside of
the length of the array?
ANS:
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

5.Write a method that takes in an array as a parameter and prints each element in the array
on its own line:
public int methodArray(int [] numArray) {
    int numbers = 0;

    for(int i=0; i < numArray.length; i++ ) {
        if(numArray[i] > numbers) {
            numbers = numArray[i];
            System.out.println(numbers);
        }
    }
    return numbers;
}

6.Assuming we have a Planet class that encapsulates data on a planet, write a new array
declaration for all the planets in our solar system that uses the Planet class:
ANS:
Planets[] planets = new Planets[10];

7.Describe the relationship between variable length parameter lists and arrays.
ANS:
Both receives a list of parameters that are treated as an array

8.Declare a 2D array representing the seating on a plane. Populate it with typical seat
references of row and letter such as 10C or 22A (using a nested loop):
int[][] seats = new int[4][3];
    for (int row = 0; row < seats.length; row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col < seats[row].length; col++) {
            seats[row][col] = row * col;
        }
    }
 }

Reflect on your learning and your needs. After this class meeting, what topics do you feel
like you learned and what topics do you feel like you need more information on to learn?
ANS:
I have been able to understand more concepts on arrays like working with 2 dimensional array
declaring an array, printing an array, populating an array with loop statement

I will need more information on arrays like working with other dimensional arrays
